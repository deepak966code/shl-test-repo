Absolutely! Here's the clean version of the `README.md` without emojis or stylistic fluff—just a straightforward, professional document:

# Semantic Search Application with FAISS, Sentence-Transformers, and Flask

This project provides a semantic search service built using:
- FAISS for vector similarity search
- Sentence-Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for generating text embeddings
- Flask for serving the search API
- Optional Docker support for containerized deployment

---

## Project Structure

```

├── app.py                 # Main Flask app
├── model/                 # Pre-downloaded SentenceTransformer model (optional)
├── data/                  # Folder for input CSVs
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/faiss-search-app.git
cd faiss-search-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download the Model

To reduce startup time and avoid model re-downloads:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
model.save("model")
```

Then update your code to load the local model:

```python
model = SentenceTransformer("./model")
```

---

## CSV File Format

Each CSV file placed in the `data/` directory should include:

- `Job Title`
- `Remote Testing`
- `Adaptive/IRT`
- `Duration` (optional)
- `Test Type` or `Keys`
- `Description`
- `Link`

Each row will be processed into a searchable embedding and added to the FAISS index.

---

## Running the Application

### Local Flask Server

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5000
flask run
```

Access the app at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

### Docker Deployment

#### Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t faiss-search-app .
```

#### Run the Container

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 faiss-search-app
```

---

## Render Deployment Notes

To deploy using [Render](https://render.com/):

1. Use the Dockerfile method.
2. Set the following environment variable:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   ```
3. Ensure the `model/` and `data/` directories are included in the build.

Note: If the model is not preloaded and saved locally, Render may kill the process during download due to timeouts or memory limits.

---

## Optional API Endpoint (if exposed)

### POST `/search`

#### Request

```json
{
  "query": "adaptive math test",
  "top_k": 5
}
```

#### Response

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Math Test | Remote: Yes | Adaptive: True | ...",
    "link": "https://example.com/test-link"
  },
  ...
]
```

---

## Requirements

- faiss-cpu
- sentence-transformers
- pandas
- Flask
- gunicorn (for production)

---

## Production Tips

- Use `gunicorn` with multiple workers:

```bash
gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

- Load the model only once during startup.
- Avoid large, unfiltered datasets on resource-constrained environments.
